## Problem Statement: Real-time equity analysis
To address the need for a real-time equity analysis tool, I propose developing a web-based application that will allow investors to track US stocks, focusing on sustainability (ESG) scores and key financial metrics. The application will use APIs to gather and display real-time data, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on sustainability, market sentiment, and financial indicators.
